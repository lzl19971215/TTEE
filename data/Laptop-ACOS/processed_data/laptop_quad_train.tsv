additionally, this has a nice backlight to the keyboard, which will turn off when nothing has been pressed for about 20 seconds ( great for when just watching or reading something ) or can be manually turned off entirely.	47,55 KEYBOARD#USABILITY positive
in addition, you are gifted with an sd card reader and an optical drive which can read and write cds and dvds ( which i can't say i've used other than testing that it worked, but i do remember how hazardous it is to suddenly need something like that and not have it available ).	58,71 OPTICAL_DRIVES#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE positive

reliability is completely terrible - i use it for work but definitely wouldn't buy for personal use as it's had to be repaired and replaced twice already - once for just momentarily stopping and then for the touch screen not working with hand input ( worked for the pen which btw is kind of useless except in a few android apps as the handwriting recognition is limited to a lame popup panel - there's no integration ).	0,0 LAPTOP#QUALITY negative	208,220 DISPLAY#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE negative

none of this means the acer chromebook 14 is a bad chromebook ; on the contrary, it is an excellent chromebook!	23,41 LAPTOP#GENERAL positive
i led with those first five points for a reason : being able to purchase a decently - performing chromebook with aluminum build, a 1080p ips display, 4gb of ram, 32gb of local storage, and an intel quad - core processor for $ 299 is basically what the entirely of the chromeos subreddit has been asking for over the past few years.	0,0 LAPTOP#MISCELLANEOUS positive
5 years old or matched by chromebooks at half the price, the absence of a touchscreen upgrade, or the use of slower emmc storage instead of a real m.	116,128 MEMORY#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE negative

i run windows and linux vms fairly regularly and while i could run them on a comparable windows system, adding windows systems to an already portly windows system has never worked out well for me, so while disappointed in the new upgrades, this 2015 model still rocks vms and does all i need it too for far less $ $ $.	222,238 SOFTWARE#USABILITY negative

the mbp does not run as hot as my old white mb did.	4,7 LAPTOP#QUALITY neutral
the battery life is really pretty comparable ( slightly more with the mbp, and i can obtain info on app energy usage a bit easier imo ).	4,16 BATTERY#GENERAL positive
the trackpad is the ultimate difference - maker for me.	4,12 KEYBOARD#GENERAL neutral
the mbp trackpad is best in class and if you are not using a mouse, this makes a huge difference.	4,16 KEYBOARD#GENERAL positive
the mbp 13 ` ` is plenty mobile.	0,0 LAPTOP#PORTABILITY positive
the one drawback is that it uses more energy than most apps on the mbp ( especially word, not so much with excel or ppt ), so i've been using google docs / drive in safari ( chrome is also an energy hog ) if i'm away from a power source and the task is light enough.	55,59 SOFTWARE#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE negative	142,161 SOFTWARE#GENERAL neutral	174,180 SOFTWARE#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE negative

the intel rst driver ( for the hybrid drive ) version is old, and causes rare system lockups.	4,20 SOFTWARE#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE negative
further, the msi dragon center ( default software on the installation ) caused a blue screen which lead to me having to factory reset.	13,32 SOFTWARE#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE negative
msi used to have a driver installer by disk that would install all the proper drivers in the right order, so you'd have the perfect configuration.	19,35 SOFTWARE#DESIGN_FEATURES positive
however, the laptop has no dvd drive, and no such driver dvd was provided.	13,19 LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES negative
